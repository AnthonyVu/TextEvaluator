# TextEvaluator
### Instructions
1. Open a shell/terminal as administrator (**windows commands**: Alt + f -> s -> a). Windows users will need to do this due to symbolic link issues on Vagrant. I'm not sure if this affects other operating systems but run as administrator just in case.
2. run 'vagrant up'
3. wait a bit (this may take a while; expect 10 to 20 minutes depending on your processor speed)
4. go to localhost:3000
5. select files to evaluate (test files can be found in 'TextEvaluator/test_files' directory if you don't want to download your own)
