# TextEvaluator
### Instructions
1. **If you are on Windows**, open a shell/terminal in the project directory as administrator (**Windows commands**: Alt + f -> s -> a). Windows users will need to do this due to symbolic link issues on Vagrant. Linux users can go straight to step 2, but if an error does occur, reclone the project, and run terminal as root.
2. run 'vagrant up'
3. wait a bit (this may take a while; expect 10 to 20 minutes)
4. go to localhost:3000
5. select files to evaluate (test files can be found in 'TextEvaluator/test_files' directory if you don't want to download your own)
