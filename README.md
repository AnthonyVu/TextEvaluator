# TextEvaluator
### Instructions
1. Open a shell/terminal in the project directory as administrator (**windows commands**: Alt + f -> s -> a). Windows users will need to do this due to symbolic link issues on Vagrant. This step may not be required for Linux users, but if an error does occur, reclone the project, and run as administrator.
2. run 'vagrant up'
3. wait a bit (this may take a while; expect 10 to 20 minutes depending on your processor speed)
4. go to localhost:3000
5. select files to evaluate (test files can be found in 'TextEvaluator/test_files' directory if you don't want to download your own)
