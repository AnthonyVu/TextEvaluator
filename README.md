# TextEvaluator
### Instructions
1. Open a shell/terminal as **administrator** (Alt + f -> s -> a). Windows users will need to do this due to symbolic link issues on Vagrant. I'm not sure if this affects other operations systems but run as administrator just in case.
2. run 'vagrant up'
3. wait a bit (this may take a while; expect 15 to 20 minutes)
4. go to localhost:3000
5. select files to evaluate (test files can be found in 'TextEvaluator/test_files' directory
